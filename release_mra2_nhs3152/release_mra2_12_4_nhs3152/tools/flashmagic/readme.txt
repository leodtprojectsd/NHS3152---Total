Various usage notes regarding Flash Magic

- Check UM11154 "NTAG SmartSensor getting started: Reprogramming an NHS31xx using Flash Magic (in the docs folder)
    for more details.

- Downloadable from http://www.flashmagictool.com.
- The free version can be used using the GUI or from the command line.
- A paid version allows for full integration in your production system.
- Versions after 10.40 have gained support for gang programming or mass programming using the command line on a Windows
    PC. Check UM11154 and the gangprogramming subfolder.
- When using the GUI version, by default the IC is not reset after flashing. Do this manually, or check the appropriate
    option.
- Erasing the complete FLASH region using Flash Magic saves costly erase operations to be done by the firmware later on.
